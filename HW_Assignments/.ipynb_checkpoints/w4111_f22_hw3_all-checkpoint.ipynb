The cylinder-sector-head addressing system assigns a unique address to each sector based on the cylinder, sector and head where it is located. This address is used to access data on the disk. Logical block addressing (LBA) is a newer disk addressing system that abstracts the disk's physical layout. Instead of assigning an address to each sector, LBA assigns a single address to each logical block of data on the disk. This allows the disk operating system to access the data without needing to know the physical layout of the disk platters."
